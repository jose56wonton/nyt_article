# Nyt_article
This is my 3rd HTML/CSS project. It is a clone of this [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) from The New York Times.

The purpose of this project was to work on my positioning skills. As you can see
I was able to use fixed, absolute, relative, and static positioning along with a couple of floating items.

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rails track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements?ref=lnav)!
