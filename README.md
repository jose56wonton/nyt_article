This is my 3rd HTML/CSS project.

As of now it is unfinished as I have found my knowledge of CSS lacking.

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rails track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements?ref=lnav)!
